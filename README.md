# UFO_sightings_R

In this repo I'm working on the UFO sightings data. The goal of the analysis is showing the number of UFO sightings in the following months, broken down into states. Since the data file is too big to be uploaded into GitHub I've located it on my Google Drive. This file can be downloaded using the below link. To open the data using the script from "ufo.R" file you will need to place them in the same directory.
